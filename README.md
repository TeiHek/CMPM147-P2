# Randomly Polaris
A project using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) to create a randomly generated scene of the night sky with the North Star. <br/>
Inspired by [this image](https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/article.27798/abs/sn-northstar.jpg) <br/>
Check out the project [here!](https://teihek.github.io/CMPM147-P2/)

## Uses of randomness
- Position of Polaris: This will likely be different depending where it is being observed from.
- Star size, count, and position: There's a lot of stars in the sky. I can't add them all in the image but I can try.
- Hills/Mountains: This will also be different depending on where Polaris is being observed from.
- Moon position, size, and orbit: I couldn't find a picture of the moon and Polaris together in one of those long exposure images, so I just added it in to add more shapes.
